# AD_fly_project
This folder contains all raw and statistical data relating to my BSc Natural Sciences Project at UEA, under supervisors Tracey Chapman and Saber Sami.

I have created this repository as I am keen to follow principles of open research to allow for replication and scrutiny of my work. Through open communication, progress can be accelerated for benefit of greater knowledge.

Please contact me if you have any questions regarding my project.
Kind regards,
Natalie
